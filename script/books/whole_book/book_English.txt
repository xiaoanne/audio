Marking the Boat to Find the Sword
A long time ago, when two good friends played together, they decided to carve a small boat by the river. They took out a sharp sword and began cutting wood. But, carelessly, the sword fell into the river! The first friend hurriedly said, “What should we do? How do you cut wood if you lose your sword?” However, the second friend was very smart. He said, “Don't worry, we can engrave a mark on the boat and write down where the sword fell!” As a result, they bravely engraved a mark on the boat. After a while, the boat drifted away, and the sword was gone. The first friend saw the boat drift away and said, “The sword must be in the boat's place!” He started carving wood in that place. However, the second friend saw something strange. He said, “It's impossible for the sword to still be there; we should look for it!” However, the first friend insisted that the sword was still in place, so they continued to carve on wood. Finally, everyone knows that the sword was washed away by the river a long time ago, but the first friend is still carving wood in place, and there's no idea that the sword has long since disappeared. This story tells us that sometimes we have to accept new facts and changes, don't be like our first friend, and insist on holding on to the wrong ideas!
