In a quiet village, there is a wise man named Li Ming. He is known for his humility, tolerance, and wisdom. People in the village often come to ask him questions. One day, a young man came to Li Ming and asked him how to make the right choices in life. Li Ming smiled and said, “Good is like water, have you ever heard this phrase?” The young man shook his head, signalling that he wasn't familiar. Li Ming begins to tell a story about a creek. He told the young people that the creek always flows naturally, whether facing a cliff or soft land. It has no fights, no resistance, and always finds the easiest path. Water is always strong and can win, yet it can always penetrate everything and moisturize the earth. “This is the meaning of being good as water,” Li Ming explained. “The highest virtue is like water. It is gentle and tolerant. It does not seek to fight, but rather uses soft strength to warm, nourish, and purify everything. At any time, you can choose to influence and change the environment around you like water, under the guidance of kindness and wisdom.” The young man understood, and decided to use this lesson as a guide, apply it in his life, and strive to be a kind, gentle, and intelligent person. Since then, everyone in the village has seen his positive changes, and he has become happier and more satisfied as a result.
