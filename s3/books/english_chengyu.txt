Everyone in the village wears simple clothes and lives an ordinary life, while Lee Ming always wears gorgeous clothes and has a unique lifestyle. One day, a wise man came to the village. When the wise man saw Li Ming, he said to him, “Young man, your heart is bright, but you are too different. Be kind to others, but you also need to learn to live in harmony with everyone and be in the same dust as the light.” Lee Ming was deeply inspired after hearing it. He began to wear plain clothes, and his life became ordinary. He took the initiative to help people in the village, do agricultural work and build houses together, and share the bits and pieces of life with everyone. As time passed, people in the village gradually accepted Li Ming, and they discovered that his heart was sincere and kind. By living in harmony with the people in the village, Li Ming understood the meaning of “being the same as light and dust.” He learned not only to maintain light and kindness in his heart, but also to integrate into everyone's lives and share their joys and sorrows with them. In the end, Li Ming became an indispensable member of the village, and his influence spread throughout the village, encouraging more people to respect, understand, and coexist harmoniously.
