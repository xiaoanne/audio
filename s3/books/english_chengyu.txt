Pride brings loss and humility brings gain
In a small town, there are two young carpenters, named Li Ming and Wang Tao. They are all famous for their superb woodworking skills, yet they have very different personalities. Because of his excellent skills, Li Ming often shows off himself in the village, claiming that he is the best carpenter; no one can match him. He began to be arrogant and impatient and stopped being humble in his studies or sharing his experiences with others. He only focuses on his accomplishments and is reluctant to acknowledge his shortcomings. In contrast, although Wang Tao also has excellent woodworking skills, he always remains humble. He humbly sought advice from other villagers, continued to learn new carpentry techniques, and then shared his experience and knowledge with others. He never takes himself at the center, but is willing to listen and cooperate. A few years later, due to Wang Tao's modesty and willingness to cooperate with others, he has built up a wide network of contacts and reputation. He has been given many new opportunities to participate in some large-scale projects, and has also received support and respect from the villagers. Meanwhile, Li Ming is gradually bothered by her arrogance and sense of isolation. He has lost many opportunities to work with him, and no one else wants to work with him again. He began to realize that his overly complacent and isolated attitude was taking its toll on him. Through this story, we can see the truth that every move harms the benefits of humility. Humility and cooperation can help us build better relationships and have more opportunities, while being too proud and isolated can only cost us.
